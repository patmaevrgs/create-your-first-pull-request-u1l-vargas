Vargas, Patricia Mae I.
CMSC 100 - U1L

Expectations:
    - I hope to pass the course with a flying tres (pwede ring uno hahaha taas ng pangarap)
    - I expect that the instructor/class discussion would be considerate of students, like me, who may take a bit more time to grasp the material/lesson.
    - I look forward to learning a lot about web programming, with the goal of independently creating a fully functional website by the end of the semester
